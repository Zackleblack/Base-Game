We are creating a first person horror game based on the backrooms and those 'Your month your_' videos. 
The player will be prompted to enter a birth month and the game will begin on whatever map that correlates with the month. I want it to have a Chilla's art and Fears to Fathom style to it. 
Gameplay will be pretty simple; just like every backrooms game, your objective is to find a way out and avoid enemies.
